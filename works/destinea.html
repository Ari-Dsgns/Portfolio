                    <p>HTML5</p>
                    <p>CSS3</p>
                    <p>Bootstrap</p>
                    <h3><strong>Project goal:</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        The primary objective was to create a travel agency website that highlights the design and layout features of Bootstrap.
                        The focus was on demonstrating how Bootstrap's grid system and components can be leveraged to build a responsive and
                        user-friendly website.

                    <h3><strong>My role: </strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for the entire development process, from structuring the HTML and applying CSS styles to implementing Bootstrap components.
                        The goal was to create a site that not only showcases Bootstrap's capabilities but also provides a seamless user experience.
                    </p>
                    <h3><strong>Challenges & lessons learned:</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        One of the main challenges was ensuring that the website was fully responsive and provided an optimal viewing experience across various devices.
                        By utilizing Bootstrap's grid system and responsive utilities, I was able to create a layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
                        This project enhanced my understanding of responsive web design and the practical application of Bootstrap's features.
