                    <h3><strong>Technologies used:</strong></h3>
                    <p>Figma</p>
                    <p>Photophop</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <h3><strong>Project goal:</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        The goal was to design an innovative portfolio prototype that reflects the photography theme through creative navigation effects.
                        This concept aims to attract attention and provide an engaging user experience in a commercial context.

                    <h3><strong>My role:</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        I was responsible for the full design process using Figma and Photoshop, focusing on visual storytelling and interaction concepts.
                        No coding was involved; the prototype serves as a visual blueprint for future development.
                    </p>
                    <h3><strong>hallenges & lessons learned:</strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Designing the camera shutter-inspired menu required careful planning to convey the animation concept visually.
                        This project strengthened my skills in UI/UX design and prototyping with Figma and Photoshop, emphasizing creativity and user engagement.
